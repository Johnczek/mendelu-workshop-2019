== Reference module heading

Introductory paragraph for the reference module. It can include inline markup such as *bold*, _italic_, and `code`.

The contents of the reference module typically consists of a single itemized list, labeled list, or table. An itemized list looks like this:

* First item.
* Second item.
* Third item.

A labeled list looks as follows:

first term:: an explanation of the first term.
second term:: an explanation of the second term.

We will likely not need to include a table in this workshop, but in case you really want to use it, here is how:

[options="header"]
|====
|Column 1 header|Column 2 header|Column 3 header
|Row 1, column 1|Row 1, column 2|Row 1, column 3
|Row 2, column 1|Row 2, column 2|Row 2, column 3
|====
