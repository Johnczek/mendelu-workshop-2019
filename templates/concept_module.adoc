== Concept module heading

An introductory paragraph for the concept module. It can include inline markup such as *bold*, _italic_, and `code`.

The contents of the concept module can consist of one or more paragraphs, itemized lists, labeled lists, or diagrams. An itemized list looks like this:

* First item.
* Second item.
* Third item.

A labeled list looks as follows:

first term:: an explanation of the first term.
second term:: an explanation of the second term.

We will likely not need to include a diagram in this workshop.
